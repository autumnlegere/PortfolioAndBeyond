# Portfolio and Beyond - Autumn Legere

## Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This portfolio includes links to previous work I have done, a brief description of who I am and what I do, and links to various platforms through which I can be contacted. I built this portfolio to show my work to future employers and clients.Having all this information in one place makes it easier for me to showcase my talents, and for employers and clients to see if I would be a good fit for them. This web page was built using HTML and CSS, and it is responsive to screen sizes 310 pixels and up.
